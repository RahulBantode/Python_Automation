    Summarry of the above loop from for loop and nested for loop in it --
    
                You can use os.walk() in a for loop u, and on each iteration it will
                return the iterationâ€™s current folder name, the subfolders in that folder,
                and the filenames in that folder.
                In the for loop, the folder is added to the ZIP file v. The nested for
                loop can go through each filename in the filenames list w. Each of these is
                added to the ZIP file, except for previously made backup ZIPs.
